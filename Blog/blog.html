                &nbsp;&nbsp; Tourism is travel for pleasure, and the commercial
                activity of providing and supporting such travel.[1] UN Tourism
                defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the
                common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday
                activity only", as people "travelling to and staying in places
                outside their usual environment for not more than one
                consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours,
                business and other purposes".[2] Tourism can be domestic (within
                the traveller's own country) or international, and international
                tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a
                country's balance of payments. The Grand Tour became a status
                symbol for upper-class students in the 18th and 19th centuries.
                In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the
                supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated
                in the European academic world. Artists, writers, and travellers
                (such as Goethe) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which
                Italy, France, and Greece provide excellent examples. For these
                reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those
                centers, where upper-class students could find rare examples of
                classic art and history.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to
        wealthy classes, who at times travelled to distant parts of the world,
        to see great buildings and works of art, learn new languages, experience
        new cultures, enjoy pristine nature and to taste different cuisines. As
        early as Shulgi, however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads
        and building way stations for travellers.[36] Travelling for pleasure
        can be seen in Egypt as early on as 1500 BC.[37] Ancient Roman tourists
        during the Republic would visit spas and coastal resorts such as Baiae.
        They were popular among the rich. The Roman upper class used to spend
        their free time on land or at sea and travelled to their villa urbana or
        villa maritima. Numerous villas were located in Campania, around Rome
        and in the northern part of the Adriatic as in Barcola near Trieste.
        Pausanias wrote his Description of Greece in the second century AD. In
        ancient China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and,
        on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.
